Among the four, **Old Mercury** was the first to whisper back. She was not small, as she is now—she was vast, denser than Earth, and wrapped in a breath-thick atmosphere that sang with electric clouds and mirrored heat until the very air shimmered with rhythm.

Old Mercury was **an Eyeball World**—one eye always staring at Sulyap. Her sunward side blistered with light, refracted into brilliant chaos by the silvery clouds. But the far side—the dark zone—lay in a cloaked half-silence, veiled in soot, storm, and diffused glows from the atmospheric spill.

Yet, it was not merely day and night that shaped it. **Alien lifeforms**, neither plant nor animal nor fungus, hung thick in its atmosphere—**sunlight-consuming veilbeasts**, draping the planet in cloud. They thrived at the clouds of the dark zone, absorbing and consuming energy. These beings carved a pupil into the eye of Mercury—**a great gray void surrounded by abyssal blackness**.

And beneath these heavens, Mercury teemed with impossible life.
