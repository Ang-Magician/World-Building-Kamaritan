**Tree Terrain and Limited Movements**
- **Strategic Use of the Forest Canopy:** Since the society lives in trees, movement and combat are heavily influenced by the vertical environment. The terrain would require advanced climbing and swinging abilities. Most combat occurs at various heights above the forest floor, meaning that terrain is both an obstacle and an asset.
- **Bridges, zip lines, and pulleys as Lifelines and Weak Points:** Bridges are essential for crossing between trees but are also vulnerable to enemy fire. A typical bridge might be narrow, difficult to repair, and defenseless once under attack. Bridges would need constant guarding by elite forces or would be reinforced with ropes and pulleys for rapid withdrawal.
- **Underground Tunnels and Subterranean Rest Periods:** During the day, soldiers might be restricted to the forest floor, where dangers like the Aswang loom. This would force soldiers to move stealthily, perhaps in underground tunnels or hidden paths through the dense forest floor that they could use for supply runs and covert operations.

Night and Day Warfare**
- **Nighttime Threats – The Aswang:** The Aswang, or other night terrors, add a dark, survival-focused urgency. Soldiers would have to retreat to the safety of the tree houses at night, and warfare during the day becomes a race against time to complete objectives or suffer catastrophic consequences.
- **Daytime Attacks and Surprise Assaults:** While the troops are on the forest floor during the day, they can launch large-scale attacks—however, they have a limited window to achieve their objectives before the night forces them to retreat. The enemy could attempt to disrupt their attacks by targeting the retreat points—making surprise raids especially crucial.
- **Limitation on Communication and Logistics:** Communication in the canopy would be highly dependent on messengers or signal fires, smoke, or perhaps a system of bells or whistles. Because soldiers cannot risk long-range communication (due to Aswang or enemy presence), small bands of highly mobile messengers would be essential.

**Guerrilla Tactics and Traps**
- **Traps and Ambushes:** The forest offers countless natural traps. Soldiers could plant concealed spears or spikes on the forest floor, using them to deter or injure enemies who venture too low. Hanging nets or vines could be rigged to fall on attackers, ensnaring them in mid-air. Camouflaged pit traps might be used to capture enemy soldiers who attempt to climb trees.
- **Poisoned Arrows and Blades:** Given that many trees are dense and could block conventional arrows, specialized arrows dipped in poison or designed to explode in mid-flight could offer strategic advantages. Assassins and elite archers would carry these weapons.
- **Ambush Points at Tree Bases:** Attackers would attempt to lure enemies into confined spaces on the ground where they can be attacked by soldiers descending from the trees or assaulting from concealed platforms.

**Types of Forces**
- **Assassins (Silent Shadows):** These warriors specialize in ambushes and stealth. They use the dense canopy to get close to high-ranking or important targets, cutting down enemies quietly from above. Their blades are designed to cut silently, and they move quickly along the branches, blending into the environment.
- **Trap Builders (Forest Engineers):** These troops are responsible for designing and constructing traps throughout the forest. They would use tree limbs, vines, and natural materials to set up hidden snares, pits, or signal systems to alert the rest of the army.
- **Elite Tree Warriors (Sky Blades):** Elite soldiers with exceptional climbing and swinging skills, these warriors use grappling hooks, ropes, and other tools to approach enemy tree houses or platforms from above. They are adept at both swordsmanship and archery, often using their agility to bypass enemy defenses.
- **Swordsmen (Treefront Guards):** The front-line fighters who handle close combat on platforms and bridges. They are skilled in fighting in tight spaces, such as narrow bridges or platforms, and act as the core of the army's defenses against invaders.
- **Archers (High Perch Snipers):** Positioned in the higher branches, archers provide supporting fire, both to suppress enemy movement and to direct their opponents toward narrow corridors where they can be picked off. They use specialized arrows to deal with enemy archers and soldiers.
- **Shieldbearers (Bastion Wardens):** These soldiers are responsible for creating walls of protection around archers and other key units, especially while crossing bridges or when defending platforms. They hold large shields to block incoming arrows and projectiles.
- **Scouts (Treepath Watchers):** A combination of reconnaissance and tracking, scouts are experts in understanding the lay of the land, marking safe paths, and identifying enemy movements. They would use elevated positions to keep a lookout for enemy advancements and relay messages using flags or smoke signals.
- **Logistics (Crawlers):** These non-combatants carry supplies, manage the forests' resources, and maintain the flow of materials needed to build defenses, repair bridges, and ensure safe travel for the soldiers during the day.
- **Bridge Engineers (Vine Masters):** Specialists in the construction and destruction of tree bridges. These engineers also create bridges that are designed to break down when attacked, or set up traps on them to ensnare enemy soldiers attempting to cross.
- **Infiltrators (Night Walkers):** These units move at night, evading both enemy sight and the dangers of the forest floor. They are tasked with infiltrating enemy camps and cutting supply lines, sabotaging infrastructure, and causing chaos without being detected.
- **Fortifiers (Root Sentries):** These troops are skilled in reinforcing tree houses and platforms, fortifying defensive positions. They can quickly repair broken floors, walls, and bridges. Their priority is ensuring the defenses are intact and operational by nightfall.
- **Beast Tamers (Forest Herders):** These warriors control animals that assist in battle. These could be trained monkeys, birds of prey, or even larger, more dangerous creatures like wild boars, all used to carry messages, disrupt enemy lines, or cause distractions during battle.

**Large Scale Warfare in the Tree Cities**
- **Coordinated Attacks in the Daylight:** Large-scale assaults would need careful coordination, with small groups taking specific objectives (like sabotaging infrastructure, cutting enemy supply lines, or disabling enemy bridges). The forces would communicate through messengers and signals, attempting to strike at the same time before the night comes.
- **Weakening Defenses through Night and Day Cycles:** As the sun sets, the attacking force would retreat to the safety of their own tree houses, possibly moving underground or back into the dense canopy. During the night, both sides would focus on defending, hiding, and preparing for another round of conflict the next day.
- **Breaking the Morale and Defenses:** Over time, the enemy’s morale could be worn down by the constant pressure. The attacking force may employ tactics like breaking floors and walls of tree houses to make it harder for the enemy to defend. If they don’t fix it by night, the risk of being eaten by the Aswang forces them into a constant cycle of desperation and urgency.
