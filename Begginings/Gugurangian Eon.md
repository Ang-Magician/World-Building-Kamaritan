## The Furnace of Origins

In the wake of Sulyap’s song—when her warmth first uncoiled through the emptiness—storms of radiant force churned the surrounding veil. Sulyap, the Watching Flame, pulsed and spun, her outer fires casting spirals of matter that clung together in a dance of fusion and collision. These spirals became the children of her breath—the Terrestrial Kin—born not as perfect spheres, but as storms made solid.

Each one was forged in violence.

**[[Kamaritan]], Venus, Mars, and Old Mercury**—none were placed gently into their orbits. They clawed their place in the sun’s embrace, dragging through a maelstrom of solar flame and molten stone. They were forged slowly, layer by tortured layer, as if sculpted by unseen fingers of force and gravity, by the will of the [[Elementals]] awakening from within them.

In this age, **the Gugurangian Eon**, the Terrestrial Kin were fire-children—writhing under oceans of magma, blistering with volcanoes that belched skyward but met only silence. There was no sky, only ash and storm. No soil, only glowing wounds. No water yet held its shape. The planets were wounded worlds, still forming themselves in a cosmos that did not yet care to look.

Comets rained like arrows from beyond. Meteoric sieges crushed plains before they were born. Craters bloomed like scars of old wars. But from this fury, **rhythm** emerged.

### Elemental Waking

Each of the four Terrestrial Kin, beneath their fire-skin, began to **resonate**. Deep within their cores, something old stirred—not thought, but cadence. These were not gods, nor beasts, but **Primordial [[Elementals]]**—awareness woven from mass, magnetism, and movement. 

- **[[Kamaritan]]**, restless and fertile, churned with tectonic longing. (AKA Earth)
- **Venus**, cloaked and introspective, held her heat like a secret.
- **Mars**, dry-lunged and distant, watched with patient gravity.
- [[Old Mercury]], closest to the blaze, was forged with excess—an overfull vessel of mass, magnetism, and mirrored light.


The Sun Celestial radiated not just warmth and light, but a strange, saturating vitality—an energy that saturated the primordial disk and seeped into the forming worlds. This energy, older civilizations believed, gave the early solar system its first taste of _will_. If life blooms richly on Earth, they would ask—what unearthly wonders might’ve emerged even closer to that divine furnace?

In the first eons, the terrestrial planets were barren warzones of magma and meteor bombardments. But when the fires cooled and the silence settled, it was [[Old Mercury]]—then a far larger, heavier world than today—that first gave rise to _civilization_. It later witnessed [[Old Mercury Renaissance]]
