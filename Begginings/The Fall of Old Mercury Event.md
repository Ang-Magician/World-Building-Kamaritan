But even with newfound power, tragedy struck.

A **lower Celestial**—**Bakunawa**, serpent of the deep dark and devourer of warmth—rose from the abyss of reality and **turned its hunger toward Mercury**. The united Mercurians fought back with all they had. They lost.

The survivors **fled**, using the magic of the unknown Celestial and the **Spatial art** to traverse the void. They carried seeds, fauna, culture, tools—**a fragment of their world**. Not everything survived the journey.

The **Amomonggo**, ever ambitious, **chose Earth**, drawn by its **rich life and pliable species**, especially the many types of humans.

The **strongest faction** chose **Mars**, seeking its semi-desolate terrain where they could avoid disturbing the native aquatic life, then still primitive and sea-bound. They worked with the now-refugee **tri-species faction**, who had fled their claim on Venus after **seeing something there that terrified them**—an event they never recorded, save for a few warnings etched in magnetic stone. Together, the two factions cohabited Mars, **terraforming it**, shaping its gravity, and nurturing its oceans with a mix of **techno-magic** and reverence.

They cohabit Mars (which has oceans back then and up to now). They lived in the desolate land while the creatures were still yet to evolve out of the water. They created an atmosphere and carefully terraformed while preserving the life in the oceans. They used magic and their artificed tech to preserve the conditions of the ocean. They also carefully added mass to Mars until it was 1.2 the gravity of Earth. They also protected the planet from multiple disasters and meteor strikes, so it's still sprawling with life today. 


Mercury at this point was eaten by Bakunawa, the crumbs of rock and other remnants around Bakunawa's colossal body soon collected to create the mercury of today (similar to today's mercury). The once strong and vibrant mercury now desolate and dead.
