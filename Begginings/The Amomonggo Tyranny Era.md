Upon Earth, the Amomonggo raged. They claimed a great archipelago marked by scars—claw-marks visible from the stars, shaping cliffs and deep oceanic trenches. They enslaved the **Homo luzonensis**, carving cities from mountains and molding the ecosystem and landscape to their will.

Though they conquered quickly, **enslaving the Homo Luzonensis**, something went wrong. Their cargo of **massive beasts**—intended as war tools and food sources—**vanished** mid-transit, never arriving on Earth. 

But the enslaved remembered. They watched, they learned. Over generations, they turned the Amomonggo’s brutality against them, sparking a revolt that broke the chains and reversed them. Homo luzonensis became the new masters, rising in knowledge and power.
