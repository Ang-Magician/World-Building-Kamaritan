## The Breath Before Time

Before all things, there was Silay, the Great Inhalation—the breath before time, long and soft and infinite. In that stillness, there were no stars, no sky, no earth. Only the Celestials stirred—unborn, unshaped, and unknowable. They did not think or will or feel, for such things were too crude. They resonated, vast chords of potential folded into each other like spiraling polyphonies of light and shadow.

And then, one of them sang.

It was not song as we know it, but a pulse—a vibration that broke symmetry. From this note spilled heat and pressure and light, expanding without center or edge. It was not an explosion, but an unfolding of a thought too large to grasp. The stars were born as droplets from that chorus, and one of these—Sulyap, the Watching Flame—we now call the Sun.

## The Weave of the Threefold Realms

As the stars bloomed across the dark, Sulyap grew. She became an anointed Celestial to bestow life, wrapping her warmth around the matter orbiting her. 

Where matter gained rhythm, the Elementals awoke.

Yet the world was empty of movement. So the Ethereals, born of reflection and potential, drifted in. They were formless, feeding on the ambient whispers of the Elementals' thoughts. One by one, they descended into the still matter and kindled the first lives. These were the Physicals, animals and fungi

Together, these three wove the Cycle of Existence:
- Elementals nourish and bind the world, their awareness and control over their domain is proportional to the intelligence and sentience of the life living in their domain.
- Ethereals carry thought and memory, giving will, life and identity to the physicals.
- Physicals give shape, form, and action—fertilizing Elementals with observation and need.     

Plants stand at the center, both real and ethereal, bridging all.
