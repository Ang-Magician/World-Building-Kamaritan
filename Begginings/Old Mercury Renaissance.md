In the first eons, the terrestrial planets were barren war zones of magma and meteor bombardments. But when the fires cooled and the silence settled, it was [[Old Mercury]]—then a far larger, heavier world than today—that first gave rise to _civilization_.

It is said that the **Golden Age of Old Mercury** lasted for millions of years. Its air, heavy and humid, nourished creatures so immense that their echoes shaped the mythology of entire future species. Among them, five sentient peoples rose to prominence, their names mostly lost to time—**except one**: the **[[Amomonggo]]**, violent and proud, warlike and clever. These towering boar-ape beings, with tusks like bone scythes and hides of bronze or black or gold, would come to mark their age with war.

The **Amomonggo** were not the only power. There existed a **tri-species faction**, united in collaboration and desperation, though their names remain lost to even the oldest tomes. Then there was the **strongest faction**, a mystery even now, known only through ancient ruins found deep within.

But war came first.

The **Amomonggo**, driven by a thirst for territory and dominance, **invaded the fertile foglands** held by the tri-species alliance. The battle raged for centuries—across cliff-hung canopies, acid rivers, and glowing wetlands. In time, the **tri-species** were **forced into exile**, driven into the **dark zone’s fringe**, a near-dead region where the fog thickened into a labyrinth and even sound struggled to travel. There, they nearly perished… but they adapted. They learned from the shadows, from the ancient creatures that survived in the cold fog, and they endured.

Yet the Amomonggo met their match when they **challenged the strongest faction**. In a war spoken of only in symbol and song, the Amomonggo were **crushed**, their armies turned to salt and ash. 

Centuries passed. And then came a moment **of convergence**.

**All three factions met once more**, not in war—but in revelation. They made **contact with the Celestials**—one of which is a being so old, they were **never born**, only remembered by the universe. The factions were offered truths—fragments of impossible knowledge. From these entities, they learned of **magic**, not in the way we know it, but as **natural laws waiting to be seen**. All three factions learned and mastered the arts to their mortal extent.

We know this only through echoes—glyphs embedded in tectonic memory, relics whose materials defy replication. The Amomonggo, in particular, left behind **traces of knowledge far beyond their crude violence**, suggesting that what they truly learned has been lost to time… or hidden deliberately.
