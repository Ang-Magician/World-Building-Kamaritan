What we now understand as the _Era of Tyranny_ began not in fire or blood, but in a whisper—one that slithered through cracks in time and pride, whispered from ancient clay tablets, and echoed through hollowed ruins. It was the Lakay who would come to dominate the great and violent Amomonggo, not through strength, but strategy, calculation, and cold patience.

They had learned well. Where the Amomonggo had conquered with brute force, the Lakay studied them, bled under them, and grew wise.

These Lakay, known to paleomythologists as _Homo Luzonensis_, were not always tyrants. In their earlier epochs, they were slaves. Before they stood atop the ruined halls of their masters, they lived buried beneath them—beaten, chained, made to work the titanic forges and war-breeding pens carved into the mountainsides by the Amomonggo. The Amomonggo—immense and brutish—were masters of conquest and steel, but blind to the cancerous seeds of ambition sown in their midst by those they thought beneath them.

Over centuries, the Lakay studied the flaws of their overlords. They learned not only the forge and the weapon, but also the soul of their enemy—its ego, its hunger, its pride. And with that knowledge, they pulled taut invisible strings. Ambition was flattered. Rivalries were seeded. Factions grew. The Amomonggo fell upon themselves like wolves in winter.

In the War of Sundered Giants, it is believed that the Homo luzonensis orchestrated a 8-year campaign—not of direct combat, but of ego, whispers, and fracture. The Amomonggo, always proud and territorial, were made to turn on one another. Their ambition was their leash, their wrath the blade with which they cut themselves open.

What little remains of their citadel-structures—vast bio-integrated colossi now buried under mountain ranges or drowned beneath coral-crusted trenches—shows evidence of internal bombardment. Something caused them to destroy their own technological marvels from within.

When the final conflagration came, it was not one decisive battle, but a slow collapse, punctuated by betrayals, catastrophic detonations, and the toppling of memory.

And in the wake of that collapse, the Lakay rose.

They did not make the mistakes of their masters. No stories of a better past would be told. The young Amomonggo were separated from their elders—indoctrinated not with remembrance, but with obedience. They were made to carry the very stones that once built their thrones. What remained of the old world was restructured to serve the new one. The Lakay adapted the cyclopean megastructures, fusing ancient war-tech with their own growing technological intricacies, building cities of glimmering veins and humming monoliths.

Yet, the Age of the Lakay was not a golden one. Their brilliance, too, bore the stain of conquest. Their empire, while ordered, became hollow. They lived in tension—a false harmony—where violence was merely caged, not unlearned. Resources dwindled. Their greed, refined by centuries of labor and resentment, led them into late decadence and late poverty. The Amomonggo, once again, rose in revolt.

This was the final collapse..

We do not know who dealt the final blow. All we find are echoes—collapsed star-furnaces, ossified ruins with no remains, and broken conduits too advanced for even our speculative reconstructions. Both the Amomonggo and the Lakay vanished from the fossil record, not with a scream, but a great and lingering silence.

Both species vanished. The Earth, as if tired of them, let the jungle reclaim the towers. The mountains drank the memories. The world reset its breath.

A long silence followed. Perhaps ten millennia. Perhaps more. This was an age of regrowth, where forests buried the past and the wind whispered secrets to no one.

Then, from the west came sails.
