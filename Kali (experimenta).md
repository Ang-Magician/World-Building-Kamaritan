Doblette
- Twirl along angle 1 and 2 mid-strike when blade it infront of face

Florette
- Stab 


Witik/Abaniko
- 


Thrust chambered vs Strike chambered
- TC has the tip of the blade/stick pointing to the front of the body, preparing to thrust/stab
- SC has the tip of the blade/stick pointing to the back of body, preparing to slash/strike

Let chabers be (where the strike comes from):
C1S = right shoulder strike chambered
C2S = left shoulder strike chambered
C3S = right rib strike chambered
C4S = left rib strike chambered
C5S = around right knee strike chambered
C6S = around left knee strike chambered
C7S = behind head strike chambered
C1T = right shoulder thrust chambered
C2T = left shoulder thrust chambered
C3T = right rib thrust chambered
C4T = left rib thrust chambered
C5T = around right knee thrust chambered
C6T = around left knee thrust chambered
C7T = between legs thrust chambered

X means either S or T. Example: C1X, it refers to both C1T and C1S.

Placements:
- High Placement (HP): C1X and C2X 
- Medium Placement (MP): C3X and C4X
- Low Placement (LP): C5X and C6X

Trajectories: it refers to where the blade/stick goes through mid swing
- High Trajectory: head area
- Medium Trjectory: rib area
- Low Trajectory: leg area

Attack dynamics
- High Placement to High placement with High Trajectory: straight
- High Placement to High placement with Medium Trajectory: lightly positively parabolic
- High Placement to High placement with low trajectory: deeply positively parabolic
- Medium Placement to Medium placement with high trajectory: lightly negatively parabolic
- Medium placement to medium placement with medium trajectory: straight (can only go from slash to thrust chambered or thrust chambered to thrust chambered, never slash chambered to slash chambered)
- Medium placement to medium placement with low trajectory: lightly positively parabolic (can only go from slash to thrust chambered or thrust chambered to thrust chambered, never slash chambered to slash chambered)
- Low placement to 

The attacks:
- High C1S-C2S: High horizontal right strike
- High C2S-C1S: High horizontal left strike
- Medium C1S-C2S: Medium lightly parabolic right strike
- Medium C2-C1: Medium lightly parabolic left strike
- Low C1-C2: Low deeply parabolic right strike
- Low C2-C1: Low deeply parabolic left strike
-
