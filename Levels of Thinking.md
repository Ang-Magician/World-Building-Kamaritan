Everyone uses the lower levels all the time. It's only momentarily the highest a person reaches is used, this is because maintaining that level of thinking requires lots of energy to maintain. 
Everyone can have different development for different levels, like someone could have a weak level 4 but a strong level 5, and an even stronger level 3. 
Level 7 is the start of 2nd tier consciousness, as it's the first to incorperate all the other perspectives before it.


Level 1: Survive
- Basic moment to moment hedonism
- They see, feel, and hear through their senses. 

Level 2: Connect
- You can now think of what's in other people's mind
- You now ask what others want or need, but it still means what those feelings of others mean to you
- "What I do affects what others think of me, and therefore what they do for me"

Level 3: Control
- You're now aware that other poeple are aware that they have feelings and needs, so you know that others have relationships with each other
- Instead of direct relations, you see social situations
- You maneuver around social situations and manipulate relationships of others to get what you want
- You'd be aware of you being in a complex social web and you can react to those relationships and excert control over your situations
- Aware that they live in a world full of different people with their own agenda. They want what they want and they're all looking out for themselves because they have to

Level 4: Belong
- The drive is to fit in
- You'd be aware that everyone is in their own situation
- You can think in other poeple's shoes
- This would be the beginning of internal morality
- It although still thinks what you subjectively think is right and wrong
- You're only concerned what you think is right and wrong
- They are able to think in a 2nd person perspective, but still biased to their personal beleifs 
- Social norms over personal needs 
- It's every man for himself, so if we don't abide by rules then life will be chaos
- They tend to assimilate and get into herd mentality in a group ideology

Level 5: Achieve
- Thinks of objective observation as a value 
- Thinks in 3rd person: if I was an alien viewing my culture/social web
- They are able to see other cultures and social norms more objectively
- What's good for one may not be good for another
- Life is about knowing how to make good things happen, keeping benefits, and always improving
- Focuses on measurable reality, control, results, and goals
- "I chose/discovered my own beleifs"

Level 6: Understand
- It recognizes the role of the perciever, a different perciever means a different perception
- The way that you lookin a 3rd person perspective would affect how you view the different cultures and social norms. All because of who you are and how you were raised
- Believes that multiple perspectives are valid and they're all right
- Aware that there are many subjectives invisible to others
- Recognizes everyone's unique perspectives as equal
- Lets themselves and people do what they want, because who is anyone to judge
- Wants everyone's perspective to be equal, even if the poeple doesn't want to
- Radical inclusivenes

Level 7: Harmonize
- The level 6 perspective gets expanded through time
- Expanding through time creates awareness of self as history of experience
- You recognize that, that unique views didn't come from nowhere, but was developed over time, and everyone else is developing over time 
- "does this behaviour fit here? if not then it has to go where it belongs, and if it does, then we can all learn something new from it"
- It's about recognizing synergistic/clashing systems 
- Knows where things belong and sees things as parts of interconnected ever evolving systems which themselves are part of bigger systems
- It's impossible to create a set of rules that will work for everyone, people are complex and situations change constantly, we need to base our choices on how systems work. Even if that means imposing restrictions, even if it feels bad saying no to some people, it's for the best.

Level 8: Sanctify
- Witness themselves change over time in the moment
- As they think and feel, new parts emerge 
- They watch their own mind construct itself as it goes 
- They not only recognize their reaction, but they know where that reaction comes from, under many layers of "why"
