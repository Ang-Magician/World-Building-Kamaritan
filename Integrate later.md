### üåë **Old Mercury: The Ethereal Furnace**

Old Mercury, the world before ruin, orbited far closer to the **Sun Celestial**‚Äî**Sulyap**, a divine, unrelenting source of **mysterious energy**.

- This energy didn‚Äôt just power ecosystems‚Äîit **powered and even held souls together**, exerting immense **ethereal pressure** that made biological form **optional**, and internal soul containment **unnecessary**.
    
- Life born there was deeply dependent on it‚Äîespecially in the **tidally locked day zone**, where Sulyap‚Äôs rays poured **directly and endlessly**.
    
- Evolution was bizarrely **top-heavy**: bone structures, pigment chemistry, and even cognition were **reconfigurable**, not through emotion or magic, but through **deliberate, hours-long biological processes** that reshaped **melanin gradients, joint positions, ligaments, and muscle tension**.
    

These beings adapted slowly, like trees or tectonic plates‚Äîbut once they changed, the new form held.

### üßä **Day and Dark Zone: Civilizations Divided**

- Creatures like the **Aswang** evolved on the **day zone**, basking in full Sulyap energy. They relied on its pressure so completely that their **souls floated, unstuck**, only stabilized by the Sun‚Äôs force.
    
- In contrast, the **Amomonggo** emerged in the **twilight-dark frontier**‚Äîwhere Sulyap‚Äôs energy was diffused, _collected but not focused_. This forced them to **evolve internal soul-retention**, a trait eventually universal in intelligent life on Earth, Venus, and Mars.
    
- Over time, the Amomonggo migrated to the day zone for its abundance, and lost memory of their dark-zone roots.

### ‚òÑÔ∏è **The Destruction of Old Mercury**

Then came **the Cataclysm**. Bakunawa, the World-Eater, _ripped into Old Mercury_. Its crust was devoured, the core exposed. Civilization ended in days.

The Amomonggo saved what they could. Onboard a planetary ark, they brought with them an unstable cargo: species born under Sulyap‚Äôs pressure, including the **Aswang**, **Manananggal**, **Sirena**, and others.

They didn‚Äôt understand that without Sulyap's pressure, these creatures would **begin to collapse**‚Äîsouls peeling away from flesh, minds unmoored, bodies fragile.

### üåä **The Ark Crash & the Fogwall of Apir**

The ark screamed through space and **crashed into present-day Chile**, fracturing the Earth and generating titanic **shockwaves**‚Äîearthquakes, tidal surges, skyward winds.

As the mega-tsunami raced west across the Pacific, it reached the reshaped, oversized Philippine archipelago: **Apir**.

- Just as the waves reached the massive **claw-shaped scar** at Apir‚Äôs heart, something happened.
    
- The waters **turned to fog**, as if vaporized mid-air by a silent reaction. The wall of mist expanded, **not pushing outward**, but absorbing, **softening everything** it touched.
    
- Apir became cloaked in a thick, eternal fog‚Äî**not caused by**, but seemingly **recognized by** the **mysterious energy of Sulyap**, echoing deep within the claw mark.
    

No one understands the claw mark. It predates the Aswang, predates the ark, but is _after_ Earth‚Äôs Hadean age. It simply _is_.

### üß† **Why the Aswang Look Human**

As the Aswang tried to survive in this new world:

1. They lost the **external soul pressure** they‚Äôd always relied on. Many simply **died**, unable to keep their own soul in place.
    
2. The survivors evolved, painfully and slowly, to **retain their souls internally**. This became easier when in a **single stable form**.
    
3. Earth‚Äôs dominant form? **Humans**. And the soul-resonance of humans shaped the Aswang‚Äôs form over generations‚Äînot magically, but **bio-ethereally**, using their internal reconfiguration traits.
    

This is why many now appear:

- **Indistinguishable from humans** (Aswang, Amalanhig)
    
- **Partially formed** (Sirena, Tikbalang)
    
- **Grotesquely adapted** (Manananggal‚Äîforced to split for soul-release during flight)
    

They became **nocturnal** not by choice, but because:

- Sulyap‚Äôs energy still reaches Earth‚Äî_but faintly_. The daytime has _some_ pressure, enough to destabilize their barely-held souls.
    
- Night offers safety‚Äînot from light, but from **the minimal etheric push of Sulyap**. It‚Äôs when their forms feel most ‚Äúnatural,‚Äù or at least least strained.
    





The Amomonggo sent 9 Arks to Earth, all 9 disappeared and only 2 came. The first impact of the ark was at modern day Chile, the second impact came 157 years later (although no new monsters were sighted, presumably because of the creatures of the fog handling it. 





## **Final Timeline for the Four Civilizations**

### **Shared Mythic Past (Proto-Austronesian Arrival to Pre-Aswang Collapse)**

- **Proto-Austronesians** arrive around 4000 BCE, bringing with them seafaring, agriculture, and language spread across the islands. Early societies are communal and interconnected, thriving in peaceful trade and spiritual harmony with the land and sea.
    
- **Pre-Aswang Collapse (1500s)**: The 1500s marks the golden age for the region, with bustling trade, rich cultural practices, and the thriving barangay system. Major kingdoms form and coalesce into complex, decentralized networks, influenced by both local traditions and distant maritime contacts. The Aswang invasion marks the end of this era.
