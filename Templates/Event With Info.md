Introduction (set up the situation): 
Example: Because of Event name 2, this happens… and Event name 1 influenced this by...
Write about the background conditions: society, politics, economy, or culture before the major shift. Introduce the historical figures or groups central to the narrative. Don’t introduce conflict yet—just facts and relationships.

Development (situations that elaborate on the opening situation): 
Here, describe how those early conditions evolved. Show progress, spreading influence, or shifting values. Expand on key developments, institutions, or reforms. Think: growing tension, technological shifts, new ideologies, or alliances—but still no major disruption yet.

The Twist/Complication: 
This is the pivotal twist. It can be a sudden policy, disaster, invention, death, or even a movement that seems to come out of nowhere. It doesn't have to directly oppose what came before—it just changes the direction unexpectedly.

Result: 
What happened as a result of the twist? How did people adapt or fail to adapt? Bring closure by showing how the world settled into a new reality. This should make sense in light of both the introduction and the twist, tying them together.
The result here will be copy and pasted into the introduction of the next event that it causes.
