It started slow. Whispers of villages disappearing overnight. Merchant boats never returning. Lone travelers found shredded on the paths. At first, the islanders tried to fight. Spears and shields, walls of sharpened bamboo, watchfires that burned from dusk to dawn.

But it wasn't enough.

The aswang came in endless waves. Not all were monstrous beasts — many wore familiar faces: mothers, brothers, childhood friends twisted into perfect masks of deception. Every defense eventually broke, whether by brute strength or betrayal from within. In some islands, entire populations were butchered in a single night. Thousands died. Blood soaked the shores, and the cries of the dying echoed over the waves.

By the time they realized they couldn't win, it was already too late.  
Those who could fled — into boats, into the sea.

Clutching nothing but what they could carry, thousands scattered into the waters, driven by desperation and a single desperate hope: to find a land the aswang had not yet claimed.

They found it at last — s large, forested island. One thick with towering ancient trees, stretching endlessly into the mist. It was not paradise. It was an island of hunger, exhaustion, and fear. But it was a place where the ground was still clean of blood.

They climbed.

They built homes in the high branches. Rope bridges stretched between great trunks. Nets were strung for gardens, lookout posts carved into thick boughs. The island's trees became their fortress against the horrors below.

For a while, they believed they had escaped.  
They were wrong.

At first, vigilance kept them alive.  
In a world crawling with shapeshifters, defensive discipline was everything. Every rope was checked twice. Every sentry sworn by blood. Every traveler inspected, no matter how familiar their face.

But no faction, no matter how desperate, could maintain perfect security forever.

Then came the _Slaughter Nights_.

These were the black marks burned into their collective memory — nights when entire tree-cities fell.

One forgotten clan left a bridge gate unguarded for a single hour — just one hour — and a howling horde of aswang ripped through the sleeping city, slaughtering hundreds before the alarm bells even finished ringing.

Another clan, too eager for the warmth of old kin, trusted a "returning cousin" who had long been dead. The shapeshifter that wore his face moved among them, cutting critical supports, sabotaging their defenses from within. When the storm came, the city collapsed — taking every soul with it into the dark below.

Other tree-cities fell more slowly, more cruelly. Ropes weakened by unseen gnawing gave way during storms. Entire platforms plunged. Hundreds died not from fangs or claws, but from the brutal pull of gravity, a mercy from being eaten alive and conscious.

Out of the original nineteen major factions that first settled the island, five lost entire bloodlines. Some could not stand alone anymore — they were absorbed into stronger clans, their names and songs vanishing like mist at sunrise.

From this bloodbath, a brutal truth was etched into every surviving heart: **one moment of softness, one blink of trust, and a bloodline could vanish forever.**  
Honor and community were important.  
But hard vigilance mattered more.

From this era came a bitter proverb:
> _"It takes a thousand days to grow a tree, but one moment to lose an entire branch."_

- Could have a grittier version, following 2 survivors to let the horror land.


In the aftermath of those horrific nights, the survivors of the Visayan clans turned their attention to survival — not just from the aswang, but from the ravages of living in a harsh, unwelcoming environment. The tree-cities became their sanctuary, but they needed to evolve. And evolve they did.

The first step was to reinforce their shelters, making them far sturdier and more defensible. Each clan constructed massive treehouses, some woven from branches and vines, others built from salvaged wood and animal skins. Cohousing became a key strategy — families and warriors alike shared space, living together not only to conserve energy but also to keep a constant watch over one another.

Rope bridges stretched high above the ground, weaving between the tallest trees. Some were simple, but others were fortified with woven nets and layers of vines. The vertical nature of their settlement meant that any attack would be met with the disorienting terrain of endless heights. They constructed pulleys for lifting supplies from the ground up to the tree-level — making the transport of food, materials, and weapons more efficient. The zip lines between trees were a signature development — perfect for quick escapes and the rapid movement of guards or supplies when needed.

And then came the alternating schedules.

The first surviving generation learned the value of constant vigilance, of never letting their guard down. There were now two main schedules for sleeping: one group woke as early as 2 AM, with their rest ending at 6 PM, while the other group woke at 11 PM and slept until 3 AM. This division allowed them to maintain 24-hour vigilance. When one set of guards rested, the other took their place. By keeping watch over the trees, their most precious resource, and ensuring no one was caught off-guard, the clans survived the aswang's relentless onslaught.

Even food production was optimized with vertical farming — crops were grown in layered gardens, terraced high into the branches. It was an act of constant balance: too little food, and they would starve; too much, and the smell could attract unwanted attention from below. Carefully calibrated planting and harvesting ensured that each tree-city could feed itself and grow.
