The rest of it was expanding on the lands and supressing rebelions. The new heir to the [[Sugbu Dominion]] actually faught the [[Maktan Dominion]], but they knew that they would bleed each other dry if they kept on fighting, so they make an agreement. The [[Sugbu Dominion]] would recognize [[Lapulapu Maktan]] as lord, while the [[Sugbu Dominion]] get special perks, including in the metals that the [[Maktan Dominion]] practically monopolized. 

His wealth was greater than all the dominions combined.

Then came the first time of civil administration on a national scale in this area. [[Lapulapu Maktan]] wanted to end the warring dominions period. He wanted to create a strong centralized government, prevent civil wars, and make the poeple be able to live in peace and prosperity. 

First he completely overhauled the tax structure. Before he could impose his will, [[Nayawa Maktan]] suggested to first send out surveyors so that they knew who had what to tax. They then sent the surveyors and categorized them by how much food they could create. It shows how much power he had, he could impose new taxes and take out age old exceptions. This was the first time, the trees and lands of [[Alimyo]] had a real unified ruler. 

Secondly, he appointed [[Nayawa Maktan]] to oversee stopping the territorial disputes and the political fighting. [[Lapulapu Maktan]] rewarded those that helped him and punish those that went against him. He ordered to be given all the weapons of the punished dominions, which he then melted and used as building materials for neutral zones-tree fortresses that anyone can enter.

Afterwards after 3 years as the new head of early [[Alimyo]], he retired, making his surviving son the next heir. [[Lapulapu Maktan]] then ruled peacefully in his home territory in the [[Maktan Dominion]].
