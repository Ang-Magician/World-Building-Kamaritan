**The Time-Tier Mandate: A Societal Framework of Duty and Efficiency**

In the vast and ordered dominion of the Datu, all land, sea, and sky fall under the stewardship of the Crown. Yet, ownership is not held in parcels of soil or mines of ore. Instead, it lies in time—the most finite and precious of all resources. This society revolves around the central principle of "Time Under Control," a political-economic structure where each person, from the lowliest Oripun to the highest Raja, trades their time to ascend and serve.

**Time as Capital** Each citizen of the realm possesses twenty-four hours in a day. These hours may be freely given, traded, or sold in exchange for necessities or opportunities. Oripun, the laboring class, trade their time to Timawa—regional stewards entrusted by the Rajas, who themselves are appointed by the Datu. A typical Oripun may initially yield twelve hours per day in exchange for access to land, food, tools, and protection. Yet, unlike traditional forms of bondage, an Oripun may offer their time to any Timawa who accepts them, based on mutually beneficial terms.

**The Multiplier System** To maintain fairness and efficiency, every individual is periodically assessed and assigned a "Multiplier" for specific tasks. This multiplier reflects the individual’s output relative to an established baseline. A 1.2x multiplier in berry gathering, for instance, means that person produces 20% more than average in the same span of time. These multipliers are certified and issued by the Datu's sanctioned assessors, bearing the royal seal, and form the backbone of labor evaluation across the realm.

This system creates a market of time-efficiency rather than pure labor quantity. An Oripun with a high multiplier may sell less time for better returns. Timawa, Rajas, and even the Datu base decisions and appointments upon these multipliers, ensuring merit remains paramount.

**Hierarchy of Command and Exchange**

- **Oripun** trade time for survival and opportunity.
    
- **Timawa** receive time from Oripun and produce material or military outputs. They manage districts with distinct specialties—mining, farming, smithing, etc.
    
- **Rajas** oversee Timawa, coordinate inter-district production, and respond to larger mandates.
    
- **The Datu** commands the entire system, requesting resources from Rajas, replacing them if inefficiencies arise.
    

At each level, superiors may request either a fixed quota (e.g., 1,232 swords) or variable quantities (e.g., as much rice as possible). Misjudging whom to ask, or distributing poorly, leads to swift replacement.

**Mandate by Replacement** No position is guaranteed. Timawa and Rajas serve only so long as they outperform peers. Their own multipliers are influenced not just by output, but by their success in training successors. If a Timawa trains two new Timawa, and those successors perform better than others, the original Timawa earns a higher multiplier score. Poor trainers are given lower multiplier score, and almost guaranteed to be replaced, as the top newly trained Timawa almost if not always surpasses their lowered score.

Thus, overlords train their competition. This system ensures no knowledge is hoarded, and no role stagnates.

**On Training the Future: The Tumao and the Babaylan** The Tumao, descendants of the Datu, undergo rigorous, lifelong training in the arts of rule, labor, and cultural heritage. Under the guidance of the Babaylan, spiritual and intellectual advisors, Tumao work alongside Oripun, Timawa, and Rajas alike. They perform every job at least once, learn every trade, and are evaluated continually.

Upon the Datu’s death or retirement at age sixty, the Tumao with the highest score ascends. Others remain in the line of succession but typically become Timawa or Rajas themselves, possessing unmatched experience.

**The Distribution Ethic** Timawa are responsible for constructing homes, ensuring fair distribution of goods, and providing custom workshops to match the skills of their labor force. They remain along with the Rajas are among the most overworked citizens, sacrificing comfort for control. The best are those who listen to their people, forecast production needs accurately, and maintain harmony.

Rajas coordinate the flow of non-local goods and military forces across the realm, and ensure that Timawa collaborate rather than compete destructively.

**Conclusion** This time-tiered society eliminates idle power. Only the most competent rise. Only the most responsive endure. And through this structured meritocracy of time and multiplier, the realm marches ceaselessly toward progress—each cog turning in pursuit of an ever-refined order.
